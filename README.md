# Thesis-Code
The following Matlab files were written for my thesis project. A setup with a camera, friction plate, force sensor and robot was designed for this project in order to further enhance the understanding of friction. Subjects place their middle finger on a pad and a robot delivers the stimulus, which is a glass plate, onto the subjectâ€™s finger. The glass plate vibrates to produce different frictional properties. The force sensor records the force changes from the finger at different frictional conditions and the camera records the physical interaction between the fingertip and glass. The Matlab code attempts to track points on interest in the video in an attempt to estimate strain values on the fingertip ridges. Video and some Matlab data files could not be uploaded because they were too large to be uploaded on github. So the files only contain the code and none of the input and output files.
